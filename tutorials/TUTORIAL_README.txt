In order to run the number of tutorials availabe for QuDiPy, you will need to
get some data for it.  
This data can be downloaded by:
1. Open Microsoft Teams and go to the "Silicon spin qubit processor" team.
2. From any channel, select Files->Open in SharePoint.  This will open up a 
    web browser to the SharePoint for this team.
3. Navigate to the base directory in Documents, and you will see a folder 
    titled "QuDiPy tutorial data".
4. You can either directly download the folder from SharePoint or sync the 
    folder with your OneDrive.
5. Copy and move the folder to the tutorials folder for qudipy which will 
    prevent you from needing to edit any of the code in the tutorials.
